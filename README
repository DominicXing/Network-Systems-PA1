On your server, run:
./server <PORT NUMBER>

On your client, then you can run:
./client <IP ADDRESS> <PORT NUMBER>

Running the server opens up a listening port on localhost on the port specified.
Running the client connects to the specified listening port on the specified IP.
 
Now the client and the server play the waiting game. The client waits for a command string then it sends it to the server for processing.

get <FILENAME>
	File opened on server and sent by maxbufsize chunks. The chunks are written to a file on the other end.
put <FILENAME>
	File opened on client and sent by maxbufsize chunks. The chunks are written to a file on the server end.
ls
	popen() opens a pipe to the 'ls' process, and then it is read line by line and shot back to the client.
exit
	Closes the pipe.
